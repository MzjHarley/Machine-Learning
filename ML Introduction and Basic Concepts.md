# Machine Learning definition
A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some task T and some performance measure(性能度量)P,if its performance on T,as measured by P,improves with experience E.  
计算机程序从经验E中学习，解决某一任务T，进行某一性能度量P，通过P测定在T上的表现因经验E提高。
# Machine learning algorithms
## The main two types of Machine learning algorithms
+ Supervised Learning: The dataset used for learning is labeled.  
+ Unsupervised Learning：The dataset used for learning doesn't have any labels or has the same labels。Known datasets, not how to process them, and no telling what each data point is.  

### Supervised learning
The term supervised learning refers to the fact that we give the algorithm a data set in which the "right answer" are given, the task of algorithm is to just produce more of the right answers.  
+ regression problem(回归问题):we're trying to predict a continuous valued output.
+ classification problem(分类问题):we're trying to predict a discrete valued output.
### Unsupervised learning
## others
+ Reinforcement learning(强化学习) 
+ recommender systems(推荐系统)
